# paper-mario-randomizer
Logic based randomizer for Paper Mario 64, using Star Rod to make the game work in rando.
THIS MOD IS A EARLY WIP!!! And does not feature randomization at all for now. The first step is to patch the game with StarRod to make it randomizable
since there are many concerns with how the game handles progression.

# How To 
1. Download and place Star Rod 0.2 folder at the repository's root
2. Place your clean Paper Mario rom at the repository's root
3. Start StarRod by navigating in it's folder and running java -jar StarRod.jar by command line
4. Set the rom path and mod path (/Star Rod Mod)
5. Dump rom assets
6. Copy assets to Mod
7. Compile Mod
8. Get your resulting file in the mod's /out/ folder
